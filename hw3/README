I did the eyelight extra credit.  I add a grayscale light of intensity equal
to 10% the magnitude of the color of the first light...

'make' to build

Run with something similar to this
./shaded 2 500 500 -eyelight < hw3_data/sphere.iv | pnmtopng > out.png


There will be debug information printed to stderr.  You can just ignore it.

I used Bill's raster functions save that instead of a function pointer I have
it take in a function object using templates.  This lets me pass in structs
and classes overloading the operator()- very useful for phong shading.
