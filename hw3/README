I did the eyelight extra credit.  I add a grayscale light of intensity equal
to 10% the magnitude of the color of the first light...

'make' to build

Run with something similar to this
./shaded 2 500 500 -eyelight < hw3_data/sphere.iv | pnmtopng > out.png
There will be debug information printed to stderr.  You can just ignore it.




NOTES
-----
I used Bill's raster functions save that instead of a function pointer I have
it take in a function object using templates.  This lets me pass in structs
and classes overloading the operator() - very useful for phong shading.

My Z-Buffer implementation is perhaps slightly inefficient - depth test occurs
in the canvas class, which is called by the drawPixel function, this results
in more drawPixel calls than necessary in cases where fragments would be
thrown out.

I'm a little sad that the next assignment doesn't use code from this.. I didn't
clean it up much as a result.  It's a bit messier than the previous assignments.

The render_scene function is very long - however, none of the parts in
it necessarily need to live in separate functions, as they would only be called
in render_scene.
