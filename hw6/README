I converted the .PNG images to .tga to use code I wrote/borrowed for a game 
project of mine.

I use a grid and change the positions according to the function
    h * cos(a * (x^2 + y^2) - t)
to compute the normals I take the x/y derivative and cross.  Easy Peasy.

Texturing is pretty simple, nothing interesting there.

W changes to/from wireframe rendering.
